[See the full list](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Alearning-exercise+org%3Akea-dev&type=Repositories). These repositories are designed to exercise different programming or technology skills. In context of KEA they are most often used in GitHub Classroom Assignments defined by instructors given to Students. But they are public and Open Source and _anyone_ - you included - can simply creatd a repository from one of the learning-exercise repositories.

The `README.md` of each repository tells you how to get started - just get cracking at it.

The articles and posts at docs.kea.dev are suplementary to the learning-exercises. It's a _build-in-public_ project and the source for the website is build using Jekyll and GitHub Pages - if you wanna take a peek under the hood have a look at [kea-dev/kea-dev.github.io](https://github.com/kea-dev/kea-dev.github.io) and maybe study the [closed issues](https://github.com/kea-dev/kea-dev.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) on the repo.
